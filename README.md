AgencyOS – Lead, Client & Sales Tracker

AgencyOS is a lightweight management system built for small agencies, freelancers, and founders who want a simple but powerful way to track tasks, clients, sales, revenue trends, and pipeline performance.

It runs two ways:

As a normal Flask web app

As a desktop application using PyWebView (so it opens like a native app)

Everything is stored locally in a portable SQLite database, making the app simple, fast, and offline-friendly.

🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Install Python

Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed:

python --version

2. Install dependencies

From the project folder:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run as a web app (development mode)
python app.py


Then open:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

4. Run as a desktop app
python desktop_app.py


This will:

Start the Flask server in a background thread

Open a PyWebView window with the app loaded inside

💡 Packaging into an EXE (optional)

Install PyInstaller:

pip install pyinstaller


Build the desktop app:

pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile desktop_app.py


This creates dist/desktop_app.exe.

(Using --noconsole hides the CMD window.)

🗄️ Database

The app uses a local file-based SQLite DB (agency.db).
If deleted, it is automatically recreated with default sample data.
